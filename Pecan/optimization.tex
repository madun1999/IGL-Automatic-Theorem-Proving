\section{Optimization}\label{sec:optimizations}

\subsubsection{Boolean Optimizations}

The following boolean optimizations are performed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lnot \lnot P$ becomes $P$
    \item $\lnot (P \land Q)$ becomes $\lnot P \lor \lnot Q$
    \item $\lnot (P \lor Q)$ becomes $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$
    \item $\lnot (x < y)$ becomes $y < x \lor x = y$
    \item $\top \land Q$ becomes $Q$
    \item $\bot \land Q$ becomes $\bot$
    \item $\top \lor Q$ becomes $\top$
    \item $\bot \lor Q$ becomes $Q$
    \item $x = x$ becomes $\top$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Arithmetic Optimizations}

Note that these optimizations are \textbf{not} sound if you've defined arithmetic predicates that don't behave reasonably.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 + x$, $x + 0$, and $x - 0$ become $x$
    \item $a + b = c$ becomes $\texttt{adder}(a, b, c)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unused Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\exists x. P$ becomes $P$ if $x \not\in fv(P)$
\end{itemize}

where $fv(P)$ denotes the free variables of $P$.

\subsection{Redundant Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x = y \land P(x, y)$ becomes $y = y \land P(y, y)$
\end{itemize}

if $y$ has a larger scope than $x$ and there are no complements between the binders of $x$ and $y$ and 
the current formula.
