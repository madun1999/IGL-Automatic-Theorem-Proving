\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Continue improving Pecan by adding new features (e.g., plotting).
    \item Explore applications of Pecan in proving theorems about Sturmian words.
    \item Create new automata to allow stating and proving new statements with Pecan.
    \item Write up the results and produce a paper. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every group member is responsible for reading the required texts and papers for background knowledge.
    \item Every group member should be familiar with running predicates in Pecan. 
    \item Group members will work on their assigned project after getting the relevant background.
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Times}
