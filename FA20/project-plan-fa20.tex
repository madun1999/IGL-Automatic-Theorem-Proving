\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Continue implementing the theorem prover Pecan from last semester.
\item Use Pecan to implement the general Ostrowki Numeration System and prove some results about these systems and Sturmian words.
\item Explore applications of Pecan in other areas of math.
\item Write up the results and produce a paper. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every group member is responsible for reading the required texts and papers for background knowledge.
\item Every group member should be familiar with running predicates in walnut. 
\item We will discuss the responsibility for theorem proving when everyone is familiar with the project background.
\item Coding responsibilities will be discussed when there is a need to do so. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Times}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Everyone will meet weekly at 3-4pm on Mondays.
	\item Undergraduate students will meet additional times as needed.
\end{itemize}
