\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Implement algorithm for addition in Ostrowski Numeration System.
\item Implement addition automata from paper by Philipp Hieronymi and Alonza Terry in Walnut.
\item Determine if theorems in Section 3 of paper by Luke Schaeffer and Jeffrey Shallit hold in the Zeckendorf numeration system. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every group member is responsible for reading the required texts and papers for background knowledge
\item One group will dedicate its time to programming the algorithms discussed in the paper.
\item The other will work more with the verifications of Shaeffer and Shallit's critical exponent work with Zeckendorf representation.

\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Times}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Everyone will meet weekly at 5-6pm on Thursdays
	\item Graduate mentors and undergraduates will meet weekly at 5-6pm on Tuesdays
\end{itemize}
