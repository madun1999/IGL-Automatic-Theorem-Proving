\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Implement a theorem prover for B\"uchi automata similar to Walnut.
\item Use the theorem prover to implement a general automata for all Ostrowki Numeration Systems and prove some results about these systems or Sturmian words.
\item Write up the results and produce a paper. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every group member is responsible for reading the required texts and papers for background knowledge.
\item Every group member should be familiar with running predicates in walnut. 
\item We will discuss the responsibility for theorem proving when everyone is familiar with the project background.
\item Coding responsibilities will be discussed when there is a need to do so. 

\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Times}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Everyone will meet weekly at 12-1pm on Wednesdays.
	\item Graduate mentors and undergraduates will meet weekly at 12-1pm on Mondays.
	\item Undergraduate students will meet over the weekend if needed. 
\end{itemize}
